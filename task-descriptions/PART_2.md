## Part 2

### Problem Statement

`npm audit` has a handy subcommand `npm audit fix` that will automatically upgrade dependencies when such upgrades do not introduce breaking changes (see [SEMVER](https://semver.org/) if this is a new concept, and you'd like to read more about it). Given a similar list of vulnerable third-party dependencies, we would like you to extend your program to exclude all the vulnerabilities where the `fixAvailable` property of the vulnerability is defined and set to `true`.

This will help users to focus on only the libraries that need their manual attention to be upgraded.

### Example input

Your program will need to take the following input, in JSON format: [part-2-input.json](data/part-2/part-2-input.json).

You'll notice that there are four vulnerabilities listed.

### Example output

And produce the following output, also in JSON format: [part-2-output.json](data/part-2/part-2-output.json).

You'll notice that there is now only 1 library listed â€“ the one that needs a major version upgrade.
