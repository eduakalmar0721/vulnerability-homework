# Coding Assignment

## What we're looking for

We would like you to demonstrate your ability to:
- Reason through a programming problem
- Understand data structures
- Write code that meets the requirements
- Write code that is easy to understand and extend
- Write tests that document and safeguard the program's behaviour
- Use a version control system (e.g. `git`) effectively to convey intent and keep changes small

Note that your program must work for the given input and produce the expected output we provide. It must also produce correct results for other similar input.

## Background

[`npm audit`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit) is a command line tool that queries [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)'s database of [security advisories](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories) in order to see if any third-party dependencies in a given [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) project are known to be vulnerable to [security exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)).

Note that you do not need to understand all the above concepts fully in order to complete the assignment – it just gives us a real-world domain to work within instead of asking you to solve a generic computer science problem you'll never face in working with us.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of vulnerable third-party dependencies, all with metadata on how severe the vulnerabilities are, we would like you to write a program that only shows those dependencies with the most severe security issues so that someone looking at the data can focus on the most important issues first.

In order of severity, the possible levels of severity are `info`, `low`, `moderate`, `high` and `critical`, where `critical` is the most severe.

For example, if an application had 3 `high` severity vulnerabilities, 1 `moderate`, but no `critical`s, then only output the `high` vulnerabilities. If it had any `critical`s, then your program would output only those.

## Example input

Your program will need to take the following input, in JSON format: [part-1-input.json](data/part-1/part-1-input.json).

You'll notice that there are 12 libraries listed with security vulnerabilities.

## Example output

And produce the following output, also in JSON format: [part-1-output.json](data/part-1/part-1-output.json).

You'll notice that there are now only 2 libraries listed – those with `high` severity vulnerabilities.

The order (of the vulnerabilities, or of the properties of the object) does **not** matter.
